**About**
This is a Spotify-like music streaming app built using a full-stack architecture. It includes a **frontend** client (React/NextJS implied by structure) that communicates with a **backend** 
API for music data. The app showcases user interface skills and practical knowledge of web development concepts. --- ## Tech Stack - **Frontend:** 
TypeScript, React/NextJS (inferred), CSS - **Backend:** JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js or similar) -
**Deployment:** Render (live link) -
**Other Tools:** Git, RESTful APIs --- ## **Features** - Browse a music catalog with search functionality - Play music, manipulate the play button, live chatting using socket.io,admin panel for noting the stats and adding music, album and their images,authentication using clerk, cloudinary as a database for storing music and images, mongo db for user details and a part of authenticatioon - Responsive UI for web and mobile views (if applicable) - Modular code structure for easy maintenance --- ## Project Structure

--- ## Setup & Run Locally 1. **Clone the repository:** ```bash git clone https://github.com/MuhammadMinhaj229/SPOTIFY--PROJECT.git cd SPOTIFY--PROJECT 

Run the backend:

cd backend npm install npm start 

Run the frontend:

cd ../frontend npm install npm start 

Access the app: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Challenges & Learning 

During development, I worked through:

Handling asynchronous API calls and state management Ensuring UI responsiveness across different screen sizes Structuring modular and maintainable frontend and backend code Future Improvements Add personalized playlists Integrate real music APIs (like Spotify’s) for real-time data Use Docker for easy environment setup Enhance testing with JUnit/Mocha, and improve performance using caching strategies
